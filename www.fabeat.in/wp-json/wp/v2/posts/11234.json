The benefits of fasting are widely known and practiced since ancient times across all cultures. In short, intermittent fasting is taking your body through cycles of eating and fasting at regular intervals. Iit lays emphasis on when you eat more than what you eat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermittent fasting can be done in the following three patterns- 16\/8, 5:2 and the 24h format. Let\u2019s take a look at each of these methods below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16\/8 method<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most commonly adopted intermittent fasting style, here your eating window is restricted to 8 hours and you shall be fasting for the remaining 16 hours in a day. For example, you can skip breakfast and break your fast for the day for lunch, say 2 pm and then have dinner at 10pm. Make sure you don\u2019t give in to any cravings during the fasting hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5:2 method<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easier of the three to start with, in the 5:2 method you eat like how you would normally do on five days of the week and then cut down the calories drastically to 500 on the remaining two days. Ideally alternate these two days rather than combining them for an easier transition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>24h method<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also known commonly as the eat-stop-eat method, here you eat like normal 6 days a week and fast for an entire day. If you\u2019re feeling it, you can switch up to fasting for two days, spacing the days alternatively. Harder of the three to follow, this is a method only seasoned fasting practitioners can use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you are familiar with all the three methods of fasting, do your research and pick a style that suits you and stick to it to see the amazing benefits of intermittent fasting to your mind and body.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Fasting is the first principle of medicine; fast and see the strength of the spirit reveal itself.<\/p><cite>Rumi<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Intermittent fasting has been the talk of the town for a while now when it comes to cutting down those extra kgs and getting a lean figure, simply by strictly adhering to proper food timings.
