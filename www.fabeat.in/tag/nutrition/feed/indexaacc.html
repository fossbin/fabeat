										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being in the midst of a global pandemic that’s spreading at an alarming rate, building our immunity is the only sure shot way to stay safe and protected. Let’s take a look at what is responsible for having a strong immunity and the ways and means to achieve it today.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Getting the right amount of sleep</strong></p>



<p>Sound sleep is the most important thing when it comes to building your immunity. As you might be aware, the body heals itself during sleep. So getting at least 6-8 hours of undisturbed sleep, punctually is vital.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Plenty and plenty of water</strong></p>

<p>Rightly known as the elixir of life, water is essential to not just quench your thirst alone and cleanse your system. Water ensures the proper circulation of electrolytes in the body, nutrient absorption and flushing out the toxins. Drink at least eight glasses of water everyday to maintain the right fluid levels in your body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green veggies and colourful fruits&nbsp;</p>



<p>The right supply of vitamins, proteins and fibres are quintessential in building your immune system and for the overall development of your body. Apart from fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, carbs, good fats all play an equally important role. Fermented foods having good bacteria that aid digestion should also be consumed for one&#8217;s gut health.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="http://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11726" srcset="https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-360x360.jpg 360w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-24x24.jpg 24w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-48x48.jpg 48w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-96x96.jpg 96w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-140x140.jpg 140w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-110x110.jpg 110w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-275x275.jpg 275w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-550x550.jpg 550w, https://www.fabeat.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It goes without saying that exercise and robust activity is essential for holding up the physical and mental health of your body. Exercise promotes good metabolism, flexibility and keeps the mind and body stress free. This in turn urges the improvement of the immune system and aids in fighting the foreign invaders to the body.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Flushing out toxins</strong></p>



<p>Overtime, toxins accumulate in the body and it has to be regularly cleaned out. Routine fasting, going easy on heavy meals and consuming drinks rich in antioxidants like green tea and lemon helps flush out the toxic substances and harmful bacteria and boost your immune system.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Thus, along with proper sanitizing and washing of hands, make sure you follow these tips to upgrade your body’s fighting mechanism and together let’s combat this epidemic.&nbsp;<br></p>
